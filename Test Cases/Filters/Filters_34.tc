   <description>Expected:&#xd;
User should able to view the &quot;Check box&quot;  icon conatins in all  Tag filter&#xd;
Actual:&#xd;
After adding more than 20 products in the admin panel, I observed that the existing tags on the front end of the application were deleted. This behavior indicates that when the admin panel exceeds a certain threshold of product additions (20 in this case), it triggers the deletion of existing tags on the front end.</description>
